# Neighborhood-map
<img src="img/logo.png" alt="">

It says "neighborhood map", but this map actually shows the area surrounding my old university instead. I spent a lot of time around these places, so I decided it was more appropiate. My city, Ciudad Obregon, is not big but I quite like it here. Hope you do too.

The [Live project](http://veritoleon.github.io/neighborhood-map/) is hosted in github pages.

This is my fifth project towards my Front-end Nanodegree.

How do I see it in action?
-------------------------------------
You can either check it at
```
http://veritoleon.github.io/neighborhood-map
```

Or you can clone this repository by running the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/VeritoLeon/neighborhood-map
```

Open [index.html](index.html) in the root folder with your browser or [dist/index.html](dist/index.html) for the production ready app.

Can I tweak it?
-------------------------------------
Sure! You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). Then, just clone this repository and install the dependencies from the command line with 
```
npm install
```

I do not recommend modifying the contents of [dist](dist), because these will be modified each time you run grunt.
