# Neighborhood-map
<p>It says "neighborhood map", but this map actually shows the area surrounding my old university instead. I spent a lot of time around these places, so I decided it was more appropiate. My city, Ciudad Obregon, is not big but I quite like it here. Hope you do too.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://veritoleon.github.io/neighborhood-map/">Live project</a> is hosted in github pages.</p>

<p>This is my fifth project towards my front end Nanodegree.</p>
